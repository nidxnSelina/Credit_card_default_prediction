# Credit Card Default Prediction

Summary:

Predicting whether a client will default on their credit card payment has been a significant part of risk assessment for credit card companies. In our project, we used 8 models to predict the case of default based on a collection of demographic, repayment status and amount records of clients in Taiwan from April to September 2005. We suggest using logistic regression, LDA, and tree model with repayment record in September, amount of bill statement, and age as primary factors to make predictions. Our model accuracy reaches 81%.
